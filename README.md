Suggested Books

Although I do not try to make a manual to write a thesis, I made some tips, mainly, in the Introduction and Statement of the Problem. Some of these tips were taken from: 

[1] Hans F. et all.(2006). How to Write a Succesful Science Thesis, The Concise Guide for Students

[2] James, E.(2003). Guide to the Successful Thesis and Dissertation, A Handbook for Students and Faculty, Fifth Edition, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

Note: Now supports utf8 and it is possible to upload it to sharelatex.com and work there
